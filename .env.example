# Example environment variables for local development
# Copy this file to `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your real keys.

# For Google Cloud SQL MySQL
DB_HOST=your-cloud-sql-instance-ip
DB_NAME=your-database-name
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASS=your-db-password

# If using Google Cloud SQL with Cloud SQL Proxy or App Engine, use the connection name
# DB_HOST=/cloudsql/your-project:your-region:your-instance

# Notes:
# - Do NOT commit the real `.env` file to version control. `.env` is already listed in `.gitignore`.
# - For Google Cloud SQL, create an instance in Google Cloud Console, note the public IP, and create a database and user.
# - Ensure your IP is allowed in the Cloud SQL instance's authorized networks.
